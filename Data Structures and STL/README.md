# Data Structures using STL

### Sequence Containers - Array, vector, deque, forward list, list

### Container Adapters - Stack, queue, priority queue (heap data structure)
Gives different methods and restricts functionality of sequence containers.

### Associative Containers - Set, map, multiset, multimap - Uses trees to implement and data is sorted always.
To store data without order in associative containers, STL provides unordered associative containers like unordered set, unordered map etc. - gives results in O(1) time.

#### Set - Uses balanced tree to implement functionality - Stores unique elements in it.
#### Map - Uses hashing and balanced tree to implement functionality - Contains keys and corresponding values.
